I found teleoperation makes it easy to adjust the angle that the arm grasps the cube. And the cube seems distorted when viewed by helmet. The ring on the arm is important for me to adjust the trajectory of the movement, and I will pay more attention to it during teleoperation."

It seems easier for performing task through KT including both low level and medium level tasks, as it doesn’t require extra thinking for the joint mobility for the robot. The headset was not very comfortable after wearing for a certain amount of time, it also doesn’t as clear as I expected. Would strongly recommend for one more round of task, I feel like I just started to understand the working principles for the robot and the tasks finished."

Wearing VR glasses sometimes could make my view sight blurry a little bit, additionally, wearing it and seeing the reality from a VR could also distracted my estimation of distance, which may affect my performance during both approaches. 2. I didn’t aware about the visualisations during the whole experiment, but I think it’s better to have some signal to note the gripper is grabbed the item, so that I know I’m ready to move the arm.  3. KT is a it hard for me to rotate ( desk too large), difficult to control (move and rotate) the arm, compared to teleoperation. Also, when doing KT, I have to move around the table, but when doing teleoperation, I can just stand in one spot and there is no many movements. "

If your face is too close to the object, the distortion would be pretty bad and make it very hard to aim.  It is fairly hard for a person to keep their hand copletely stable. The slight, uncontrollable movement of the hand makes it harder for one to keep the robot completely stable, during the study, I have to use my other hand to stabilise my hand, gripping the controller.  My preference between the two ways differ and different tasks. In the first two tasks, easier to use KT as there isnt a lot of aiming that is required to complete the task. However, in the third task it is easier to use the remote controller as I can aim at a slightly further distance, makes the  not so bad and the whole task a lot easier.  Because I’ve done a lot of meta quest three gaming at home, the weight feels less obvious to me as I pay less attention to the weight of the headset."
